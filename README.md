There are four different kinds of heroes(Mage, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior), which only can equip certain types of weapons and armor. Each Hero has a name, starts and gains different hero attributes/stats when leveling up, and deals damage based on a certain stat. Heroes has four item slots(Weapon, Head, Body, Legs) where they can equip weapons and armor depending on the slot. Equipped items increase the heroes stats. 

Each item got a name, requiredLevel and slot. There are two types or Items, Armor and Weapon. 

Armor holds stats and can be equipped on all item slots except the Weapon Slot. An piece of armor can be one of the 4 Armor types (Cloth, Mail, Leather, Plate). 

Weapon holds weapon damage and can only be equipped on the Weapon Slot. A weapon can Â§be one of the 7 Weapon types (Staff, Wand, Bow, Dagger, Sword, Hammer, Axe).

The user can call different methods to display heroes or show damage on the visual studio console log.
